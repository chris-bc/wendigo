# [NOT YET WORKING] esp32-wendigo
ESP32 firmware to accompany the Wendigo Flipper Zero application.

ESP32-Wendigo **will be** an ESP32 firmware to monitor and analyse WiFi, Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy devices. See https://github.com/chris-bc/wendigo for more information on the Flipper Zero application. Unlike previous applications, ESP32-Wendigo **will not** provide a CLI/console application suitable for use with other hardware; the ESP32 I/O is based on a binary protocol to feed relevant data to Flipper Zero, which contains the complete client application (i.e. Flipper does not just display the console output of the ESP32).
