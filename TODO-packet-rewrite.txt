* Add auth mode (find it in probe response)
* Change channel and RSSI back to integers
* Make SSID variable-length
* Update wendigo_wifi_ap and wendigo_wifi_sta to hold MACs, not object pointers
* Add network_list[] to STA data model and packet

* Refactor wendigo_device free/cleanup functions
* Fix interactive mode display bug by only updating lastSeen if the required period has elapsed - Kludgey, but it'll probably never be used anyway - And Flipper creates its own timestamp so it won't affect Flipper-Wendigo
* Review ESP32 wifi parsers and ensure that a STA's AP and an AP's STA have their MACs recorded in the object even if we don't have an object for them.
